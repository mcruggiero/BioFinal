Hemocyanin is the main oxygen carrying protein commonly used in the blood of arthropods, mollusks, and some other invertebrates. It is of interest in biomedical research because of its use as an adjuvant in vaccine development [1]. Unfortunately, current production of hemocyanin is extremely expensive, with the harvesting process requiring blood from a sea snail called the Keyhole Limpet.

We hope to focus our study of Key Hole Limpet hemocyanin (KHLH) around three main lines. First, A brief overview of copper in the body. What do we see in an overabundance in the human body, determining if this equates to more cancer if those genes associated with these disease states are dis-regulated, if not what other diseases have been associated. Second, we hope to understand some of the differences in KHLH versus the hemocyanin in other invertebrates. In this step we will not only try to answer "how is KHLH different?," but we also explore useful datascience multiprocessing and visualization tools. Finally, we discuss other species with similar hemocyanin and propose some candidate species as possible alternatives to KHLH.
